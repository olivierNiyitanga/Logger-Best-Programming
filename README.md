1. What is Logging?
Logging is the process of recording information about the execution of a program. It helps developers understand the flow of the application, diagnose issues, and monitor the application's behavior.

2. Why Logging is Important

Debugging: Helps trace errors and understand application flow.
Monitoring: Allows continuous monitoring of the application's performance and behavior.
Auditing: Keeps a record of activities, which is useful for auditing and compliance.
Maintenance: Assists in maintaining the application by providing a historical record of issues and changes.


3. Understanding Logging Levels
Logging levels help categorize the importance and type of log messages. Common levels include:

FATAL: Severe errors causing premature termination.
ERROR: Runtime errors or unexpected conditions.
WARN: Potentially harmful situations.
INFO: Informational messages highlighting the progress of the application.
DEBUG: Fine-grained informational events useful for debugging.
TRACE: Finer-grained informational events than DEBUG.
